# BinarySearch
This repository contains a simple implementation of the binary search algorithm in C++. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and comparing the target value to the middle element of the interval.

Features
Efficient Searching: Operates in O(log n) time complexity.
Easy to Use: A straightforward function that takes a sorted vector and a target value as inputs.
Clear Output: Provides user-friendly messages indicating whether the target was found and its index.
